  <h1 class="mb-4">About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I’m Krishna Kumar Acharya, currently pursuing a Diploma in Information Technology at the Royal Institute of Management.
    As a passionate and curious IT student, I’m driven by a desire to explore how technology can solve real-world problems
    and create innovative solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    My interests span across software development, AI and machine learning, game development, and web technologies.
    I enjoy turning ideas into functional projects — from building chatbots and APIs to designing interactive websites
    and experimenting with offline AI tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m particularly drawn to practical, hands-on learning, where I can apply theoretical knowledge to real applications.
    Whether it’s coding in Python, developing with Flask/Django, experimenting with Unity, or creating polished,
    user-friendly designs, I focus on producing results that are both functional and professional.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond academics, I believe in continuous learning, problem-solving, and staying updated with emerging technologies —
    all while keeping a balance of creativity and technical precision. My ultimate goal is to grow into a skilled IT
    professional capable of contributing to impactful tech solutions.
